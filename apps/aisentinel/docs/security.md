# AI SENTINEL Security Safeguards

This document describes the security controls, safeguards, and threat mitigations implemented in AI SENTINEL. It is organized by category and references specific code locations.

---

## 1. Multi-Tenant Data Isolation

AI SENTINEL is a multi-tenant SaaS application. Every data model containing customer data includes an `organizationId` foreign key and all queries are scoped through the `organizationProcedure` middleware.

### Architecture

All 10+ tRPC governance routers use `organizationProcedure` (read) or `orgWriteProcedure` (write) which both enforce:

1. **Authentication** — user must have a valid session
2. **Organization membership** — user must be a member of the requested organization (verified via `OrganizationMember` table lookup)
3. **Org-scoped queries** — all Prisma queries filter by `ctx.organization.id` (the verified org ID from the middleware, NOT the raw input)

**Key file**: `src/server/trpc.ts`

### Safeguards

| Control | Description | Location |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Org middleware | Verifies membership before any org-scoped operation | `src/server/trpc.ts:63-106` |
| Query scoping | All `findMany`, `findFirst`, `count` queries include `organizationId: ctx.organization.id` | All routers in `src/server/routers/governance/` |
| Member operations | `updateMember` and `removeMember` verify target member belongs to the caller's org | `organization.ts` |
| Policy system links | `linkSystem`/`unlinkSystem` verify both policy and system belong to the caller's org | `policy.ts` |
| Risk classification | `getById`, `getHistory`, and `classify` all scope queries by `organizationId` | `riskClassification.ts` |

### Global (non-org-scoped) tables

These tables are intentionally shared across all orgs:

- `ComplianceFramework` and `ComplianceRequirement` — reference data (EU AI Act, NIST, ISO 42001)
- `ShadowAITool` — shared catalog of 67 AI tools
- `VendorCatalog` — shared vendor directory from Vendor.Watch
- `AIAssessmentTemplate` — system-level templates (org templates are org-scoped)

---

## 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### Role Hierarchy

```
OWNER > ADMIN > AI_OFFICER > MEMBER > VIEWER
```

### Write Protection

All mutation endpoints (create, update, delete) use `orgWriteProcedure` which blocks the `VIEWER` role from performing any write operations.

**Key file**: `src/server/trpc.ts` — `enforceWriteAccess` middleware

### Elevated RBAC

Certain sensitive operations require `OWNER`, `ADMIN`, or `AI_OFFICER` roles:

| Operation | Minimum Role | Location |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Add org member | ADMIN | `organization.ts:addMember` |
| Update member role | OWNER | `organization.ts:updateMember` |
| Remove org member | ADMIN | `organization.ts:removeMember` |
| Make oversight decisions | AI_OFFICER | `oversight.ts:addDecision` |
| Approve assessments | AI_OFFICER | `assessment.ts:processApproval` |
| Publish policy versions | AI_OFFICER | `policy.ts:publishVersion` |
| Approve policies | AI_OFFICER | `policy.ts:approve` |

### Procedure Types

| Procedure | Auth | Org Check | Write Check | Use Case |
|-----------|------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `publicProcedure` | No | No | No | Reference data (frameworks, requirements) |
| `protectedProcedure` | Yes | No | No | User-level operations (list orgs, create org) |
| `organizationProcedure` | Yes | Yes | No | Read operations (list, getById, getStats) |
| `orgWriteProcedure` | Yes | Yes | Yes (blocks VIEWER) | All mutations (create, update, delete) |
| `adminProcedure` | Yes | Platform admin | No | Platform admin operations |

---

## 3. Authentication

### Providers

| Provider | Environment | Guard |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Dev Credentials | Development, plus sovereign production builds that set `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCAL_AUTH_ENABLED=true` | Enabled when `NODE_ENV === "development"` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCAL_AUTH_ENABLED === "true"`, unless `DISABLE_DEV_AUTH === "true"`. A runtime check additionally refuses `VERCEL_ENV === "production"`. Honest caveat: this provider is passwordless and creates an account for any email typed into it, and it DOES work in sovereign production builds with the flag on. That is acceptable only behind 127.0.0.1 or a firewalled LAN; see the hardening section of `deploy/sovereign/README.md` |
| Cross-Login SSO | Hosted cloud only by default | Provider registered only when `CROSS_LOGIN_ENABLED === "true"`, or by default when running on Vercel (`process.env.VERCEL`). Tokens verified via JWT (`CROSS_LOGIN_SECRET`) or Google userinfo |
| Google OAuth | All (when configured) | Standard OAuth 2.0 flow with `state` check |
| Email Magic Link | All (when configured) | Resend email delivery |

**Key file**: `src/lib/auth.ts`

### Session Security

- **Strategy**: JWT-based sessions
- **Cookie naming**: `__Secure-aisentinel.session-token` (production), `aisentinel.session-token` (development)
- **Cookie flags**: `httpOnly: true`, `sameSite: "lax"`, `secure: true` (production)
- **Domain scoping**: `.todo.law` in production (allows cross-subdomain SSO)
- **CSRF token**: Separate `aisentinel.csrf-token` cookie

### Domain-Based Auto-Join

When a user signs in, their email domain is matched against `Organization.domain`. If matched, they are automatically added as `MEMBER` role. This is logged in the audit trail. No email domain receives premium entitlements or elevated roles automatically: sign-in never provisions entitlements.

---

## 4. Input Validation

### Zod Schema Validation

All tRPC inputs are validated using Zod schemas before reaching business logic. Enum fields use strict `z.enum()` validation matching Prisma enum values:

| Router | Validated Enums |
|--------|----------------|
| `aiSystem` | `AITechnique` (12 values), `AISystemRole` (5), `AISystemStatus` (5) |
| `incident` | `AIIncidentType` (11), `IncidentSeverity` (4), `IncidentStatus` (5), `TaskStatus` (3), `NotificationStatus` (3) |
| `vendor` | `VendorRiskLevel` (4), `VendorStatus` (5), `VendorAssessmentStatus` (4) |
| `oversight` | `GateType` (5), `GateStatus` (5), `OversightDecisionType` (3) |
| `policy` | `PolicyType` (9), `PolicyStatus` (5) |
| `assessment` | `AIAssessmentType` (5), `AssessmentStatus` (5) |
| `riskClassification` | `AIRiskLevel` (4) |
| `compliance` | `ComplianceStatus` (5), `EvidenceType` (8) |

### SQL Injection Prevention

- Prisma ORM provides parameterized queries for all database operations
- No user-controlled raw SQL anywhere. The only `$queryRaw` in the app is the constant `SELECT 1` liveness probe in `/api/health`
- Search inputs use Prisma's `contains` operator with `mode: "insensitive"`, which is safe

### String Length Limits

All user-facing text inputs have length constraints:
- Names: `z.string().min(1).max(200)` or `.max(300)`
- Free-text descriptions: `z.string().min(1)` (Prisma `@db.Text` handles storage)

---

## 5. HTTP Security Headers

Configured in `next.config.ts`:

| Header | Value | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `X-Frame-Options` | `DENY` | Prevents clickjacking |
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff` | Prevents MIME-type sniffing |
| `Referrer-Policy` | `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` | Controls referrer leakage |
| `X-DNS-Prefetch-Control` | `on` | Performance optimization |
| `Strict-Transport-Security` | `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` | Forces HTTPS |
| `Permissions-Policy` | `camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()` | Disables unnecessary browser APIs |

---

## 6. API Surface Protection

### External API Routes

| Route | Auth Method | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `/api/trpc/*` | NextAuth JWT session | All tRPC endpoints |
| `/api/auth/*` | NextAuth built-in | Authentication flows |
| `/api/billing/portal` | NextAuth session | Stripe billing portal redirect |
| `/api/checkout/*` | NextAuth session + Stripe gating | Checkout session creation |
| `/api/cron/sync-catalog` | Bearer token (`CRON_SECRET`) | Vendor catalog cron sync |
| `/api/import/portfolio-vendors` | API key (`VW_IMPORT_API_KEYS`, comma-separated `x-api-key` values) | Vendor portfolio import |
| `/api/webhooks/stripe` | Stripe webhook signature verification | Payment webhooks |
| `/api/export/*` | JWT-authenticated GET + org-membership check + audit log | PDF report exports |
| `/api/health` | Public (operational metadata only, no tenant data) | Liveness/DB probe for monitors and the sovereign Docker healthcheck |

### Webhook Verification

Stripe webhooks verify signatures using `verifyWebhookSignature` before processing any payment events.

### Cron Endpoint Protection

The vendor catalog sync endpoint (`/api/cron/sync-catalog`) requires a `Bearer` token matching `CRON_SECRET` from environment variables.

## 7. Audit Trail

### AuditLog Model

All create, update, delete, and significant business operations are logged to the `AuditLog` table:

```
organizationId, userId, entityType, entityId, action, changes (JSON), createdAt
```

### Logged Operations

- Organization membership changes (add, remove, auto-join)
- AI system CRUD
- Risk classification changes
- Assessment lifecycle (create, submit, approve/reject)
- Oversight decisions
- Incident lifecycle
- Policy changes and approvals
- Vendor management
- Shadow AI reports
- Compliance mapping updates

### Audit Log Retention

Audit logs use `onDelete: SetNull` for the organization and user foreign keys, preserving log entries even if the referenced org or user is deleted.

---

## 8. Data Protection

### Sensitive Data Categories

| Category | Fields | Protection |
|----------|--------|------------|
| OAuth tokens | `Account.refresh_token`, `access_token`, `id_token` | Stored as `@db.Text` by NextAuth adapter |
| Vendor contacts | `AIVendor.contactEmail`, `contactName` | Org-scoped access only |
| Incident details | `AIIncident.description`, `rootCauseDescription`, `impactDescription` | Org-scoped, RBAC-protected |
| Assessment responses | `AIAssessment.responses`, `mitigations` | Org-scoped, RBAC-protected |
| Policy content | `AIPolicy.content`, `AIPolicyVersion.content` | Org-scoped, RBAC-protected |
| Billing identifiers | `Customer.stripeCustomerId` | Opaque Stripe IDs, org-scoped |
| License keys | `SkillEntitlement.licenseKey` | CUIDs (not cryptographic secrets) |

### Data Cascade Behavior

Deleting an AI system cascades to all related records:
- Models, data sources, risk classifications
- Assessments, oversight gates, compliance mappings
- Policy system links

This is by design — removing a system from the registry removes all governance artifacts. The `VIEWER` role cannot trigger deletions (blocked by `orgWriteProcedure`).

### Robots.txt

The `robots.txt` blocks crawlers from accessing:
- `/api/` — all API endpoints
- `/sign-in` — authentication pages
- `/verify-request` — email verification
- `/governance/` — all dashboard pages

---

## 9. Premium Feature Gating

Premium features (Shadow AI, Vendor Catalog, Conformity Assessment, Bias & Fairness) are gated by the entitlement service at `src/server/services/licensing/`.

- Entitlements are checked at the tRPC router level before any data access
- Each premium router calls `checkAccess()` / `checkAssessmentEntitlement()` before proceeding
- Entitlements are stored in `SkillEntitlement` linked to `Customer` and `SkillPackage`
- Support for `SUBSCRIPTION`, `PERPETUAL`, and `TRIAL` license types

---

## 10. Known Limitations and Roadmap

### Implemented

- [x] Multi-tenant org isolation on all queries
- [x] RBAC with VIEWER write protection
- [x] Dev auth production safeguards
- [x] Input validation with Zod enums
- [x] HTTP security headers
- [x] Audit logging for all mutations
- [x] Webhook signature verification
- [x] Cross-tenant isolation on member operations
- [x] Policy link/unlink org verification
- [x] Org-scoped return queries (all `findUnique` after `updateMany` replaced with org-scoped `findFirst`)
- [x] Consistent `updateMany` pattern for mutations (incident tasks/notifications)
- [x] `/api/health` endpoint (no secrets, no tenant data) + sovereign Docker healthcheck
- [x] CI gates on every push: ESLint, security convention linter (`npm run lint:security`), `tsc --noEmit`, vitest regression tests (org isolation, auth callback, seed gate), production build

### Future Improvements

| Item | Priority | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Rate limiting | HIGH | Add rate limiting on public endpoints, auth flows, and mutation endpoints |
| OAuth token encryption | MEDIUM | Encrypt `Account.refresh_token`/`access_token` at rest |
| Soft delete | MEDIUM | Add `deletedAt` timestamp to critical models (AI systems, assessments) instead of hard delete |
| Column-level encryption | MEDIUM | Encrypt sensitive `@db.Text` fields (incident descriptions, assessment responses) |
| Audit log IP/userAgent | LOW | Populate `ipAddress` and `userAgent` fields in audit log entries |
| Data retention policies | LOW | Implement anonymization schedule for audit logs and PII |
| Content Security Policy | LOW | Add CSP headers for additional XSS protection |
| Session rotation | LOW | Implement JWT rotation with shorter `maxAge` |
| Domain auto-join approval | LOW | Require admin approval for domain-matched organization joins |
