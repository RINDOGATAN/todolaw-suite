# Privacy Program Quickstart

DPO Central's **Quickstart** feature helps new organizations bootstrap a complete privacy program in minutes instead of hours. It's available at **Dashboard > Get Started** (or directly at `/privacy/quickstart`) and offers two complementary approaches that can be used independently or combined.

---

## Overview

| Approach | Direction | What it does | Pricing |
|----------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **Vendor Import** | Bottom-up | Select vendors you already use; auto-generates data assets, elements, processing activities, and data transfers from each vendor's known data profile | Requires **Vendor Catalog** entitlement |
| **Industry Template** | Top-down | Choose your industry; get a pre-built scaffold of internal data assets, processing activities, and data flows | Free (AGPL core) |

Both approaches are **non-destructive** — they only create new records and never modify or delete existing ones. Duplicate names are automatically skipped.

## Bottom-Up: Vendor Import

### How it works

1. User searches the Vendor Catalog (a starter catalog of common SaaS processors)
2. Selects the vendors their organization actually uses (multi-select, up to 20)
3. For each vendor, the system looks up the vendor's **catalog category** and maps it to a predefined data profile
4. A preview shows exactly what will be created per vendor
5. On confirmation, a single database transaction creates all records

### What gets created per vendor

| Record type | Example (for a "Digital Analytics" vendor like Google Analytics) |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Vendor** | Google Analytics, status: Prospective, categories: ["Digital Analytics"] |
| **Data Asset** | "Google Analytics (Analytics & BI)", type: CLOUD_SERVICE |
| **Data Elements** | IP Address, Device Fingerprint, Page Views, Session Duration, Click Events, Referral Source, Browser & OS, Geolocation |
| **Processing Activity** | "Website/App Analytics — Google Analytics", legal basis: Legitimate Interests |
| **Data Transfers** | Auto-created for each non-EU data location with Standard Contractual Clauses |

### Category mapping groups

Vendor catalog categories are mapped into 20 groups, each with a tailored data profile. Groups accept both the new VW canonical category names and legacy freeform names for backwards compatibility.

| Group | VW Canonical Categories | Typical elements |
|-------|------------------------|------------------|
| Analytics & BI | Analytics & BI, Personalization & Engagement | IP Address, Device Fingerprint, Page Views, Session Data, Click Events |
| Marketing & Advertising | Marketing Automation, Advertising | Email, Name, Company, Marketing Preferences, Campaign Interactions, Cookies |
| CRM & Sales | CRM & Sales | Name, Email, Phone, Company & Job Title, Deal Data, Communication History |
| Customer Data Platform | Customer Data Platform | Unified Profile, Cross-device IDs, Behavioral Segments, Transaction History |
| Cloud Infrastructure | Cloud Infrastructure, Data Warehouse & Integration | Application Data, Server Logs, Stored Records, Backups |
| Content & E-commerce | Content Management, E-commerce | User Accounts, Orders, Shipping Address, Content Interactions |
| Customer Support | Customer Support, Communication | Name, Email, Phone, Ticket Content, Call Recordings |
| AI & Machine Learning | AI & Machine Learning | User Prompts, Chat Transcripts, User Identifiers, AI Model Outputs |
| Surveys & Feedback | Surveys & Research | Respondent Email, Survey Responses, NPS Scores |
| Payment Processing | Payment Processing | Cardholder Name, Payment Card Data, Billing Address, Transaction Records |
| HR & People | HR & People | Employee Name, National ID, Salary, Employment History, Performance Records |
| Developer Tools | Developer Tools | Server Logs, Error Stack Traces, User Session Context, IP Addresses |
| Security & Identity | Security & Identity | User Credentials, Access Logs, IP Addresses, Security Events |
| Privacy & Consent | Privacy & Consent | Consent Records, Cookie Preferences, Data Subject Requests |
| Productivity & Collaboration | Productivity & Collaboration | User Profiles, Messages, Shared Files, Activity Logs |
| Legal & Compliance | Legal & Compliance | Signatory Info, Contract Content, Digital Signatures, Audit Trail |
| Design & Creative | Design & Creative | User Accounts, Creative Assets, Collaboration Data |
| Events & Webinars | *(legacy only)* | Attendee Name, Email, Company, Dietary Requirements |
| Tag Management | *(Developer Tools > Tag Management subcategory)* | Page URLs, Event Data, Cookie Data, User Agent |
| Communication & Messaging | *(legacy only)* | Contact Info, Message Content, Video Recordings |

Vendors whose category doesn't match any group get a **generic "Third-Party Service"** mapping with basic identifiers and usage data elements.

### Data transfer detection

When a vendor's `dataLocations` includes countries outside the EU/EEA adequacy list, the system automatically creates **DataTransfer** records with:
- Mechanism: Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)
- Safeguards: "SCCs with supplementary measures"
- Linked to the vendor's processing activity

The adequacy list includes all EU/EEA member states plus countries with active EU adequacy decisions (UK, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland, Canada, Argentina, etc.).

### Entitlement gating

Vendor import requires the **Vendor Catalog** entitlement (`com.nel.dpocentral.vendor-catalog`) or the **Complete** package. Organizations without access see the vendor card as locked with a "Premium" badge.

## Top-Down: Industry Template

### How it works

1. User selects from 6 industry templates
2. An expandable preview shows all assets, activities, and flows in the template
3. Items that already exist in the organization are marked and automatically skipped
4. On confirmation, a single transaction creates all records with correct cross-references

## Wizard Flow

The quickstart page (`/privacy/quickstart`) walks users through a multi-step wizard:

```
Step 1: Choose Path
  Select "Import from Vendor Catalog" and/or "Start from Industry Template"

Step 2A: Vendor Selection (if vendor path chosen)
  Search catalog, multi-select vendors, see live preview of what will be created

Step 2B: Industry Selection (if industry path chosen)
  Pick template from grid, expand to preview all assets/activities/flows

Step 3: Review & Confirm
  Summary counts (X assets, Y elements, Z activities...)
  Non-destructive notice
  "Build My Privacy Program" button

Success Screen
  Links to Data Inventory, Processing Activities, Vendors, Dashboard
```

If both paths are selected, the wizard flows: Choose > Vendors > Industry > Review.

## Vendor.Watch Integration

Users who have built a vendor portfolio in Vendor.Watch get a seamless onboarding experience.

### How it works

1. DPO Central and Vendor.Watch share the same Neon PostgreSQL database and NextAuth session (SSO via `.todo.law` cookies)
2. `VwPortfolioVendor.accountId` maps to the shared `User.id` from the NextAuth users table
3. When a user arrives at the DPO Central dashboard, the system queries their VW portfolio
4. If a portfolio is detected and the org has few records, a tailored card appears showing the portfolio vendors and a "Build Now" button
5. Clicking the button navigates to `/privacy/quickstart?from=vendorwatch`
6. The quickstart wizard shows a **Welcome step** with the portfolio listed, offering three choices:
   - "Yes, build my privacy program" — proceeds straight to vendor review
   - "Yes, and also add an industry template" — enables both paths
   - "Let me choose manually" — falls through to the normal wizard

### Dashboard detection

When the org is fresh (few records), the dashboard shows one of two cards:

```
If portfolio exists → VW-specific card with vendor names and "Build Now" button
If no portfolio    → Generic quickstart card with "Get Started" button
```

Both cards use the same condition:
```
showQuickstart = totalAssets <= 2 AND totalActivities <= 1 AND activeVendors <= 1
```

### Portfolio pre-selection

When arriving via `?from=vendorwatch`, the wizard automatically:
- Fetches the user's VW portfolio via `quickstart.getPortfolio`
- Pre-selects all non-imported vendor slugs
- If no portfolio is found, falls back to the normal "choose" step

---

## Dashboard Integration

A quickstart card appears at the top of the Privacy Dashboard (`/privacy`) when the organization has few records. The card variant depends on whether the user has a Vendor.Watch portfolio (see above).

The card disappears automatically once the organization has populated its privacy program.

## Technical Details

### API Endpoints

All endpoints require authentication and organization membership (`organizationProcedure`).

| Endpoint | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `quickstart.getPortfolio` | Query | Detects VW portfolio for the current user, returns vendor list with dedup info |
| `quickstart.listTemplates` | Query | Returns lightweight list of all 6 industry templates with counts |
| `quickstart.previewVendorImport` | Query | Returns preview of what vendor import would create, including dedup info |
| `quickstart.previewIndustryTemplate` | Query | Returns full template preview with existing-record detection |
| `quickstart.execute` | Mutation | Creates all records in a single `$transaction()` |

### Deduplication

Before creating any record, the execute mutation checks for existing records by name within the organization:
- Existing **vendors** (by name) are skipped entirely
- Existing **data assets** (by name) are skipped but their IDs are still resolved for activity linking
- Existing **processing activities** (by name) are skipped

### Audit Trail

All records created by quickstart are tagged in the audit log:
- `action: "CREATE"`
- `metadata: { source: "quickstart" }`
- `changes` includes `source: "quickstart"` and the template ID or catalog slug

### Source Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/config/vendor-data-mappings.ts` | Category-to-data-profile mappings, EU adequacy list |
| `src/config/industry-templates.ts` | 6 industry template definitions |
| `src/server/routers/privacy/quickstart.ts` | tRPC router with preview + execute endpoints |
| `src/app/(dashboard)/privacy/quickstart/page.tsx` | Multi-step wizard UI |
| `src/app/(dashboard)/privacy/page.tsx` | Dashboard with conditional quickstart card |
